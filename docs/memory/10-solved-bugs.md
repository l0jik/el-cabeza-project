## 10. Other solved bugs worth remembering

- `camera.lookAt()` silently corrupts the camera matrix if given a plain
  `{x,y,z}` object instead of a real `THREE.Vector3` (it checks
  `.isVector3`, and failing that calls `Vector3.set(target, undefined,
  undefined)`, producing NaN). This is exactly the kind of bug that makes
  every subsequent "does it fit" check in a bisection search trivially
  return true, collapsing a zoom-fit search straight to `ZOOM_MIN` — real
  root cause of a "views always zoom in far too close" bug that looked
  unrelated on the surface. Any new fit/measurement code must construct
  real `Vector3`s.
- Singularity's intentionally-oversized decorative glow (bleeds past its
  own button) was making its scrolling ancestor show a scrollbar, since
  an oversized absolutely-positioned descendant counts toward scrollable
  overflow even when purely decorative. Fixed with `contain: layout` on
  the button, not by shrinking the glow.
- A missing `cabezaInDanger` import was caught only because the phase-2
  extraction smoke test actually *exercised* `computeTension` rather than
  just checking it imports — a reminder that the smoke tests earn their
  keep by calling real code paths, not just construction-checking.
